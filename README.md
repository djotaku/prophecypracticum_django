# Prophecy Practicum (Django version)

This is a project I created for a friend of mine who needed to reduce his administrative burden on an exercise he does as part of his religious practice. The goal is to automate as much as possible so that he can focus on the parts that require a human.

## History (or, when to use which framework)
This is a redo of the project I was working on in this repo: [https://github.com/djotaku/prophecypracticum](https://github.com/djotaku/prophecypracticum). As I worked on it, I realized for the specifics needed for this project that I was spending a bunch of time recreating that which Django would give me for free.

So I'm taking the knowledge I've gained from various recent web projects to try and redo this in Django and spend less time working on things that have already been invented for Django. 

This has already proven fruitful as my current progress (20210323) was achieved with only about 2 hours of work all summed up.
